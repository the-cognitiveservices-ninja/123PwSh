### Elements of the extension pack

##### [Powershell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.windows-terminal)

Develop PowerShell modules, commands and scripts in Visual Studio Code!  

This extension provides rich PowerShell language support for [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) (VS Code).
Now you can write and debug PowerShell scripts using the excellent IDE-like interface
that Visual Studio Code provides.

This extension is powered by the PowerShell language server,
[PowerShell Editor Services](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices).
This leverages the
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
where `PowerShellEditorServices` is the server and `vscode-powershell` is the client.

Also included in this extension is the PowerShell ISE theme for Visual Studio Code. It is
not activated by default, but after installing this extension either click "Set Color
Theme" or use the [theme picker](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes) and
select "PowerShell ISE" for a fun and familiar experience.

##### [Azure PowerShell Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azps-tools.azps-tools)  

Automate the migration of Azure PowerShell scripts and modules from AzureRM to the Az PowerShell module  

Effortlessly migrate your PowerShell scripts from AzureRM to the [Az PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

This repository includes a PowerShell module and a VSCode extension to automate the migration of
your PowerShell scripts and modules from AzureRM to the Az PowerShell module.

The current version of the migration toolkit is aimed at AzureRM to Az migration. We are
considering adding the additional capability to migrate between Az versions
